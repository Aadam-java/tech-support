/**
 * This class implements a technical support system. It is the top level class 
 * in this project. The support system communicates via text input/output 
 * in the text terminal.
 * 
 * This class uses an object of class InputReader to read input from the user,
 * and an object of class Responder to generate responses. It contains a loop
 * that repeatedly reads input and generates output until the users wants to 
 * leave.
 * 
 * @author     Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes
 * @version    0.1 (2016.02.29)
 * Q2: class documentations include sections such as class declaration, descriptions, method summaries,etc.
 * they help us understand the class its methods and how to use them.
 * Q3: I'd say they have the same use except the one with the int toffset just allows us to choose where
 * the code starts to check
 * Q4: endsWith(String suffix) and the return type is boolean
 * Q5: length() and the return type is int
 * Q6: I would say it is easy to find if you know what to look for since you need to know the methods name
 * however you could use google to find the methods name and then use java api to help explain it to you
 * Q7: public String trim() 
 * String text= "Goodbye!";
 * String trimmedtext=text.trim();
 * Q10: boolean
 * Q12: it generates random pseudo-numbers and is in the java util package
 * Random rand = new Random();
 * int randomInt = rand.nextInt();
 * Q15: nextInt(int bound), when calling nextInt(100)  the numbers generated will be any number 0 to 99
 * Q21: you can use it as instead of the random class however its said its better for cryptography.
 * random numbers are important for cryptographic security to ensure strong unpredictable keys to protect
 * against cyber attacks and hackings.
